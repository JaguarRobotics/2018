    //// joystick.

    // number it is.

    // by subclassing Button you can create custom triggers and bind those to
    // commands the same as any other Button.

    // three ways:
    // Start the command when the button is pressed and let it run the command
    // until it is finished as determined by it's isFinished method.
    // button.whenPressed(new ExampleCommand());
    // Run the command while the button is being held down and interrupt it once
    // the button is released.
    // button.whileHeld(new ExampleCommand());
    // Start the command when the button is released and let it run the command
    // until it is finished as determined by it's isFinished method.
